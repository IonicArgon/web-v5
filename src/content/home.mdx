# Hey there!

I'm Marco (he/they), **Mechatronics & Biomedical Engineering** student at
McMaster University and **Chief Technology Officer** at
[crewd.](https://crewd.ai/) I think this is the fifth time I've redesigned my
personal website? Hopefully I can stick with this one for a while.

I'm hoping to use this place to share my thoughts, projects, and experiences;
off the top of my head, probably stuff about **software development** generally,
maybe some **music**, **chess** (if I get back into it), and
**random things** that I find interesting.

## Cool Buttons

I know that it's semi-ironic to have these buttons here since you almost always
see them on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS sites (NeoCities, Geocities, etc.) and this
is probably as bloated of a website as it gets (Next.js, MDX, TailwindCSS, etc.),
but hey, I like them.
