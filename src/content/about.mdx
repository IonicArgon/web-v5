# About Me

Some miscellaneous random tidbits about me (potentially informational, or not).

## Music

Used to have a Spotify playlist here containing twelve or so songs that *truly*
represented my awesome(?) music taste, but I removed it because I don't really
want DRM on my personal blog.

I'll update this section with something else later, but at a glance, genres
I listen to are:

- Classical
- Generic lo-fi whatever
- Generic synthwave whatever
- Generic radio station pop
- Japanese jazz fusion
- Metalcore, nu-metal, and other derivatives
- "Old people music"
- Indie
- i dunno, like, basically anything atp

## Recommended Games

Couple of games that I really like.

- [Slay the Princess](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/) -
  Love the story, the art, the music, the everything. Even if you don't like visual novels, give this
  one a try if you love horror.[^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2]
- [Hades](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/) & [Hades II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II) -
  Very fun roguelites. Great art style and music. Love the characters and story.
- [9 Kings](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/) - Pretty fun
  strategy rougelite. Love me some "big number go brr" games.
- [Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210320/Potion_Craft_Alchemist_Simulator/) -
  Chill alchemy sim if you're into more casual stuff.
- [DELTARUNE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/) -
  I don't really need to say much about this one. **play the damn game.**
- [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) - Open-sourced version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe. It's fun setting up
  giant train highways that would never exist in real life.

## Software

Here's some of the tools that I use.

- **OS**: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
- **WM**: [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) and [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri)
  - **hyprland Dots**: [HyDE](https://github.com/HyDE-Project/HyDE)
  - **niri Desktop Shell**: [Dank Material Shell](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell)
  - **Terminal Emulator**: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
  - **Shell**: [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- **Editor**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (I'm basic, I know)
- **Browser**: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

I've been experimenting with niri on `ia-workstation` and have been liking the experience so far.
Been meaning to also switch `ia-nomad` to niri as well, but I've just been lazy, honestly. 🙃

build my own at the time.

### `ia-nomad`

[^1]: witch my beloved 🥰
[^2]: It is a horror game, so you might want to **check the [content warnings](https://blacktabbygames.com/content-warnings-stp)**
[^3]: Never buying from Dell ever again. This laptop **sucks**. I've replaced
      the fans like 6 times now and it also overheats like crazy unless you
      configure clock limits and undervolting correctly.
[^4]: The motherboard caps the speed to 2666 MHz 😂😂😂
