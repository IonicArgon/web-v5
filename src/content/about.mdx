# About Me

Some miscellaneous random tidbits about me (potentially informational, or not).

## Music

I've added a couple playlists here that (probably) reflect my music taste.

This one is the "someone asked me about my music taste" playlist. Hopefully it
stirs more questions than answers. You're welcome

<SpotifyPlaylist playlistId="1pdh1hS1JO1Pv044JfWMbh" />

Here's the miscellaneous "old people" playlist.

<SpotifyPlaylist playlistId="3RIdOQc841CjagG1QOLnGo" />

Some Japanese jazz fusion.

<SpotifyPlaylist playlistId="08kwdxoBHzLKHt5jdufLqk" />

"Angry music."

<SpotifyPlaylist playlistId="4hAjdZ5zfH3xkOkMEx2qpm" />

And a bunch of generic radio songs you listen to while driving because you couldn't
be bothered to connect your phone to the car.

      configure clock limits and undervolting correctly.
